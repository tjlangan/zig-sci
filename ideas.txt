Matrix
	- Determinant
	- Rank 
	- Power
	- Inverse
	- Eigen
	- Ax = b
	- elementwise trig/log/exp functions
	- Linear Systems of Eqns
	- N-dimensional stuff 
	- To / From file (csv, txt) 
	- easier getters/setters
	- Dot / Cross products 
	- range or linspace initialization
	- comparisons (lt, gt, eq, ...)
		- will return a either a smaller matrix of those that fulfill the condition or a logical of the same size 
		- if logical will need a way to get the values that fulfill 


Calculus
	- Integration
	- root finding
	- min/max finding
	- ODEs 
		- Euler / Runge-Kutta 
	- PDEs 
	- Interpolation

Signals 
	- Create
	- Read / Write wav files
	- FFT / IFFT / FFTSHIFT
	- Convolution
	- Filtering

Plotting
	- this sounds annoying
        - look for existing C lib that can be imported 

Chemisty
	- Periodic Table
            - Every element is a struct with their properties as fields. 
            - Write directly or load in config file?
	- Equation Balancing 

Physics Constants
	- Speed of Light 
	- Boltzman
	- Gravitational 
	- Avagadro's
	- unit conversiono

General 
	- more error handling and type checking
	- implement matrix functions into the matrix type
	- documentation
